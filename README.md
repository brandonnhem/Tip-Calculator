## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Using `addEventListener` is the key to this project. I was stumbling around and was trying to find ways to register the inputs. That is entirely what the `index.js` file is composed of.

I'm fairly proud that I was able to complete this using pure JavaScript. Most solutions to problems I came across recommended jQuery, but I wanted to stick to JavaScript only.

### Continued development

Hoping to develop more websites with less _hacky_ methods. My main struggle was getting the dimensions and layout right. My solution felt inadequate as I hardcoded pixels in to get it right on my screen. I felt satisfied with how it looks, but in the future I plan to use more methods that aren't absolute in the pixel placements.
